A student at a certain university wishes to know if he will get placed at campus recruitment. The data at hand are marks of 10th,12th, degree and MBA along with specialisation in respective field.
What follows in the notebook is explorary data analysis with visualisations which helps estimate the probability of getting placed in the recruitment process.

Ans) As per the values obtained in the correlation dataframe in the notebook, it can be concluded that SSC percentage contributes maximum to the probability of getting placed followed by HSC and DEGREE percentages respectively.


Q2) Does percentage matters for one to get placed?

Ans) By analysing this dataset it can be determined that, a student scoring more than 60% in his/her exams has a good chance of getting placed.


Q3) Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?

Ans) Marketing and Finance is demanded more by corporate.
NOTE: Marketing and HR does not lag by a great difference and can be considered as a reliant specialisation too.


NOTE: As the data is considerably small (200 observations) predicting salary using Machine Learning was not ideal. Complex algorithms tend to overfit the data and hence are not included in the project.
